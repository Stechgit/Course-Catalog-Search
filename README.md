# Course-Catalog-Search

This program was a collaborative effort between myself and another student.
The program serves two functions.

1. It allows the user to search the TN Tech course catalog to see which classes are offered in each semester.
2. It tells the user which hour of the day the most students are on campus.

The goal of the project was to identify when parking was least available on campus.  

The database that this program uses is no longer active so this program no longer functions,  however you can see a custom animation I created for a loading icon by searching for all classes during the Spring or Fall semester.

This is a screenshot of the project in use.  Here you can see the program
determine the timeslot with the maximum amount of students each day, and then selects from that list what time during the week is the highest population on campus.
