# Course-Catalog-Search

This program was a collaborative effort between myself and another student.
The program serves two functions.

1. It allows the user to search the TN Tech course catalog to see which classes are offered in each semester.
2. It tells the user which hour of the day the most students are on campus.

The goal of the project was to identify when parking was least available on campus.  This was our solution to this problem.


To start the program, open index.html.

The landing page shows the user a course search box, here you can filter the search through 7 different filters.

<b>SEMESTER and YEAR are required fields.  E.x., "Spring" and "2023". </b>

Additional Filters:

DEPARTMENT: Filter by department.  E.x., "CSC", "MATH", "PHYS" for Computer science, Mathematics, or Physics

COURSE NUMBER: Filter by course number.  E.x., "1300", "2400", "3710", for specific courses offered.

BUILDING: Filter by building location.  E.x., "BRUN", "PRSC", "LSC", for specific buildings on campus.

START TIME/END TIME: Filter by start and end time, currently only accepts military time format with no colon. E.x., "800" for start time and "1500" for end time.

Filters can be combined, for example searching for "FALL 2022 CSC 1310 BRUN" will filter to only the Data Scructures and Algorithms classes offered in the Bruner building.

The tabs that appear at the top of the course catalog show the maximum number of students on campus on each day with the given filters, as well as the weekly maximum.

To perform a new search, click the "New Search" button and reset the fields.
